      <h1>The Future of the Internet</h1>
      <aside>
        This is an example article to shows how Paragraph works.
        I wrote it during my study of <i>Human Aspects of Information Technology</i>.
      </aside>
      <p>
        The internet is the publicly accessible global network of billions of computers,
        ranging from ordinary home and business PCs to smartphones, satellites,
        and supercomputers. Due to the decentralized nature of the network it is
        impossible to oversee, control, or dominate all of the information that passes
        it. With the rise of the internet of things (Kranenburg, 2008) the number of
        connected devices will surely continue to grow indefinitely.

              <p>
                The assignment was to write a paper that discusses the
                forces that act on the internet today, and make a prediction about
                what the resulting internet will look like in the year 2020.
              </p>
      </section> -->
      <p>
        Where is this going? This question is on the minds of many internet users,
        civil servants, and corporate shareholders. If they could only predict the future
        of the internet they would have certainty and could make the right decisions
        about regulations and business strategies.
      </p>
      <aside>
        I've converted it from PDF back to text. There may be some incorrect
        references and hyphenation artefacts.
      </aside>
      <p>However, posing this question
        in the first place exposes a flaw in their thinking. The question “where is the
        internet going?” presupposes that the internet is an autonomous entity that
        is somehow controlling culture and society (Lister, Dovey, Giddings, Grant,
        & Kelly, 2009). Asking this question shows fear of the internet’s influence
        while disregarding the role humans themselves have in shaping the internet.
        In reality, the internet isn’t going anywhere without the efforts made by users,
        governments and businesses. That means the real future internet depends on
        the outcome of the battle for control these parties are fighting today. In this
        article I will show what this battle is about and argue that the outcome will
        favor only one group—the users.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand where the internet is going, one first needs an understanding
        of where it came from. In the first part of this article I will outline the
        evolution of the internet until the present day. In the second part I will discuss
        today’s different visions about the internet’s future, and try to expose
        the underlying dimension on which they differ. Finally, I will extend today’s
        trends into the future and sketch the internet of 2020.
      </p>
      <h2>1. History of the Internet</h2>
      <p>
        After Charles Babbage invented the Analytical Engine in 1837, it took science
        one hundred more years to arrive at the first general-purpose, Turing-complete,
        digital electronic computer: the ENIAC. The successors of this monstruous
        30 ton machine soon evolved into more manageable sizes due to the
        inventions of the integrated circuit board and the microprocessor. As these
        systems were acquired by universities, institutions and corporations, the Advanced
        Research Projects Agency (ARPA) devised the necessary technology
        to connect them through telephone landlines. The resulting ARPANET consisted
        of interconnected mainframe computers—mostly room-sized PDP-10
        computers and closet-sized PDP-11 computers located at large US-based organizations
        (Waldrop, 2008). In 1974, Cerf, Dalal, and Sunshine proposed a
        method for connecting other computer networks to the ARPA network, allowing
        computers that were originally located in separate, local networks
        to communicate with all other connected systems using an inter-network
        protocol—the internet was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        The founders of the internet and the emerging online subculture placed
        strong values on the sharing of information and the openness of communication.
        They condemned the use of copyright law to restrict their freedom in
        sharing and modifying software, and reacted to this practice of the emerging
        software industry by releasing their own software without any restrictions
        on its use, modification, and distribution. This formed the foundations for
        the increasingly popular Free and Open Source Software movement. They
        also deemed the use of open standards for communication a critical requirement
        for a manageable, scalable, and publicly accessible internet. To that
        end, the early network researchers working for ARPA created the tradition of
        public development and publishing of internet-related standards through the
        so-called Request For Comments (RFC) documents; human-readable, ASCII-encoded
        text files. Today, a number of organizations are devoted to sustain
        the public nature of the internet and the open development of standards.
        Since 1992 most of them are united through the Internet Society, who’s mission is
        “to promote the open development, evolution, and use of the Internet
        for the benefit of all people throughout the world.” (Internet Society, 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet finally reached its mainstream public with the announce
        of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1990. This web is the enormous, ever-increasing
        set of publicly available HTML-coded webpages distributed on the
        internet using the HTTP protocol. These standards were invented by Sir Tim
        Berners-Lee and are maintained in an open fashion by the World Wide Web
        Consortium. It is this web of information that is commonly referred to as “the
        internet”, but there’s no reason other technologies than HTTP/HTML can’t
        make use of the internet. And indeed, new technologies continued to emerge
        in the 2000s, some of them (e.g., BitTorrent, Skype, instant messaging, online
        gaming) quickly approaching the popularity of the orginal web. The biggest
        change in the last decade, however, was the rise of Web 2.0.
      </p>
      <h2>2. The Internet Today</h2>
      <p>
        The limited and static WWW of the early 1990s, with its lack of search
        engines, the animated “under construction” banners on personal homepages,
        and the top-down content-generation approach taken by early internet companies,
        stands in sharp contrast with today’s Web 2.0. This new view of
        the web is characterized by a dynamic, bottom-up, collaborative, and open
        approach to content-generation. It’s both remarkable and natural that the
        new generation of internet users developed the same values of collaboration,
        openness and sharing as members of the early internet subculture did. The
        major successes of Web 2.0 include numerous forums and blogs as well as
        projects like Wikipedia, Youtube, and Digg. A related class of successfull
        Web 2.0 projects consists of social networking sites like Facebook, MySpace,
        LinkedIn, and Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message of the internet’s success is clear: there is no need for a
        centralized power structure to manage communications, resources, people, and
        communities. The internet will increasingly empower ordinary users. When
        this trend towards decentralization continues, the internet could ultimately
        completely overthrow traditional centralized organizations and even governments.
        However, existing corporations and governments will of course try
        everything in their power to provide a counterforce. The resulting battle between
        the opponents and the proponents of an open and unrestricted internet is already
        in motion (Singel, 2010). Both sides are proposing increasingly
        drastic measures to protect their own interests. I will discuss two of these
        opposing views for the future of the internet; Charney’s (2008) End to End
        Trust vision and the Free Culture Movement.
      </p>
      <h3>2.1 End to End Trust</h3>
      <p>
        Charney (2008) argues that the internet of today is riddled with privacy,
        security, and safety issues. The continuing growth of the medium will likely attract
        even more criminal activities like copyright infringement, identity theft, extortion
        and espionage. The internet actually fosters crime by its global reach,
        the possibilities for anonymity and untraceability, and the abundance of valuable
        targets of attack. The majority of computer users lack the knowledge to
        prevent or act on those crimes, and thus depend on their hard- and software
        manufacturers to protect them from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current architecture of the internet does not allow for a solution to
        this problem, according to Charney. The ultimate responsibility lies with the
        end user, who can always be tricked into providing private information or
        who’s computer can be compromised by malicious software. To protect the
        user, the framework of the internet needs to be changed fundamentally. This
        can be accomplished with the idea of trusted computing. First, devices need
        to be replaced with trusted stacks, uncrackable combinations of authenticated
        hardware, software, users, and data. Second, users need to be identifiable and
        held accountable for their actions, so they can be properly prosecuted when
        they commit a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charney’s vision of End to End Trust has been opposed by the advocates
        of a free and open internet, most fiercely by Richard Stallman, founder of the
        GNU/Linux operating system and the Free Software Foundation.1 Stallman
        (2007) claims that trusted computing is not defending the users’ interests,
        but the interests of large media corporations that want to secure the distribution
        of their content. On a trusted stack, copyright holders can impose any
        limitation they want upon the user. Rooted in the early internet subculture,
        Stallman’s values of openness and sharing pertain directly to standards of
        communication and software, but they have been extended to include other
        sorts of creations by law professor Lawrence Lessig in his book Free Culture:
        How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture
        and Control Creativity (Lessig, 2004), by which he founded the Free Culture
        Movement.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2 Free Culture Movement</h3>
      <p>
        The Free Culture Movement is today’s embodiment of the internet users’
        philosophy of openness and sharing. It promotes the freedom to modify and
        distribute creative works like software, writings, images, music and films.
        The sharing of information, its members claim, is vital for the innovation
        in technology, sciences, and arts. Therefore, the movement opposes existing
        copyright laws, arguing they hinder creativity even though they were originally
        intended to promote it. According to Lessig (2004), this has resulted in
        a “read-only” internet where most people only consume content, because it
        is illegal to to reuse and expand it in a true Web 2.0 fashion.
        A notable accomplishment of the Free Culture Movement is the Creative
        Commons license, which was popularized with its adoption by Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
        This copyright license explicitly grants the user certain rights, for instance
        the freedom to modify and redistribute a creative work. Because copyright
        laws were originally intended to only prohibit users’ rights, this new use of
        copyright law is sometimes called copyleft. This is the same principle that is
        used for the licensing of Free and Open Source software like GNU/Linux. In
        both cases, however, there is a catch: A user is only allowed to distribute a
        creative work without posing any further restrictions on it. This means that a
        modified work can only be distributed under the same copyleft license, which
        guarantees that all “offspring” of a particular creation will always remain free.
        This has led to an ever-expanding universe of free software, books, music and
        other creations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between the End to End Trust vision and the vision of the
        Free Culture movement differ in more than just their view of the role of copyright
        law. They also differ in the way the original WWW and Web 2.0 differ;
        it is the difference between a centralized, top-down, and closed approach to
        the internet and a collaborative, bottom-up, and open approach. The both
        ends of this spectrum are of course extremes, but hopefully they signify what
        today’s debate about the internet is really about. In the next section I will
        explain why the open side of the spectrum is winning this debate, and what
        the resulting internet will be like.
      </p>
      <h2>3. The Internet of 2020</h2>
      <p>
        In the previous section I have tried to show in what aspect the different
        visions about the future of the internet diverge, namely on the dimension
        between a free and open internet that continues to empower ordinary users
        on one side, versus a closed and “trusted” internet that restores the power
        of centralized corporations on the other. Clearly, the odds are in favor of the
        users. It were the early users that shaped the internet and it are the many new
        users that are driving today’s success of Web 2.0 and its valuable ecosystem
        of free creations. How is it possible that ordinary users are winning a power
        struggle that most of them don’t even consciously participate in? To answer
        this question, I will have to return to the point I made in the introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet is not an autonomous entity that is taking society into a new
        “information age”, it is society itself that is empowering its members via the
        means the internet infrastructure provides. Since this infrastructure is open
        and decentralized, all participants have an equal oppurtunity to make themselves
        heard or to offer their services to other users. The internet was built
        from the ground up to offer this freedom as its default option. Corporations
        and governments who succeeded in the past to lock users into their services
        (e.g., the printing press, newspapers, mail, and television) will fail in their
        attempts to seize power over the internet, for instance by the “uncrackable”
        trusted computers discussed earlier. The democratic-by-default nature of the
        internet ultimately undermines every such attempt. Even the Chinese government,
        notorious for its efforts to censor the internet, could not prevent
        the Chinese users in standing up for their rights by posting an open letter to
        their government and Google (Anonymous Chinese netizens, 2010). However,
        the battle between users that are trying to free the potential of the internet
        and corporations that are trying to restrict it is far from over. Indeed, the
        greatest fear of the inventor of the web Tim Berners-Lee is “that it’s taken
        over by either a very large, powerful company or a country” (Internet Governance
        Forum, 2009). Fortunately, given the long-standing record of success
        of the free and open aspects of the internet, this is very unlikely to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        What will happen is a massive expansion of online content in the next
        decade. There will be an explosion of data, according to Evans (2009). The
        average amount of personal data doubles roughly every year, leading to a
        thousandfold increase in ten years. The average computer user will then
        maintain 130 terabytes of information. The amount of information corporations
        will accumulate about their users’ behavior will grow even faster,
        doubling almost every four months. This will lead to a 50-fold increase in
        only two years, and will possibly have multiplied by millions in ten years.
        This poses new challenges for the continuation of a free and open information
        society. At first, corporations will be reluctant to give free access to the
        data they accumulate, Governments will have to device new laws to overcome
        both the interest of corporations to maintain competitive and the interest of
        individuals to control their privacy. Berners-Lee (2009) pleads for a new web
        of data. An internet where everybody shares all data with everyone will foster
        creativity, innovation, economy and the valuable understanding of the world
        and nature. In ten years, the web will be thousands, perhaps millions times
        as large as it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue of online criminal activities, as outlined by Charney (2008), will
        still be there in 2020, and will most likely continue to exist forever. There is
        simply no trusted stack that can eliminate evil intentions, and if it is ever
        released, the criminals will simply not buy it. However, there’s no reason to
        be pessimistic about it. In ten years, a new generation of computer users will
        have grown up, and they will be tech-savy enough to manage their online
        identities and they will help to protect the older generations from harm. As
        always, only a very small proportion of them will engage in criminal activities.
        As always, politicians will propose new laws to deal with new types of crime
        and, as always, criminals will ultimately be caught and prosecutued. Besides,
        in 2020, you can probably buy an insurance for identy theft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet’s culture of openness and sharing will produce countless
        innovations over the next ten years. There’s a whole generation of internet
        users getting connected right now, and as they discover the myriad of
        online sources they will be inspired to build upon them, resulting in great
        technological, scientific, cultural and even political advances. As of now, the
        European government supports this vision, emphasizing a future internet of
        users, services, content and things (European Union, 2010). However, this
        vision will be subject to change, as the advocates of a more restricted internet
        will do everything in their power to have their visions institionalized as
        well. Therefore, it is of critical importance that freedom remains the default
        option of the internet, even when the success of the internet’s decentralized
        power structure will lead to the unavoidable debate on the nature of politics
        itself. Could there be a Government 2.0? Perhaps not in ten years, but the
        discussion will have started by then.
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude, the internet of 2020 will be mind-boggling, although from
        2020’s perspective it will be a commodity. Access to the internet will be a
        fundamental human right (GlobeScan, 2010). Great progress will have been
        made on both technological grounds by advancing network speeds and storage
        limits, and on cultural grounds by connecting and educating new users. It
        will be available to every world-citizen, allowing them to understand and
        influence the world arround them in a true democratic fashion. It will bring
        together individuals, groups, and countries, resulting in a vibrant, global,
        online community.
